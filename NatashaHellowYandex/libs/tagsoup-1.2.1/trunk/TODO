These will be fixed for the 1.3 release:

Consider having elements that suppress reopening
Handle namespace declarations semi-properly
Squelch namespaces better in --nons mode
Clean systemids as well as publicids
Deal with zero or negative length ids in DOCTYPE declarations
Fix duplicate attributes to use the last value, not the first

These may never be implemented.  If you'd like to implement one yourself,
feel free to send me a patch.

Flag added parent elements with a special attribute
Allow case sensitivity as a standard feature
Make use of the pseudo-comment in a script element to suppress close-tag detection
Allow inline cruft in table bodies and rows
	(Don't break up tables, ever?)
	(Don't break up forms, ever, either?)
Suppress start-tags for some restartable elements if the element
	is already on the stack (<b><b> is the same as <b>)
Combine consecutive body elements
If attributes are URIs, eliminate spaces and newlines altogether
Clean up tags opened but not closed inside a table cell
